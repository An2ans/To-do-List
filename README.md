# To-do List

This is a To-do list linked with a MongoDB so I can keep my notes and tasks to do in the same app. It is my first project with Mongodb using mongoose, as well the first time I used EJS.

Different lists can be set up just by typing after the root, example: /Work will create a new list named "Work" while /Home will create "Home" list.
